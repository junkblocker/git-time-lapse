# [git-time-lapse](https://github.com/junkblocker/git-time-lapse)

Fork of [git-time-lapse: Perforce-style](http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=3849) for vim/neovim

## Description

You're editing a file which is in a git repository. Press a key which
opens a new tab which shows how that commit changed that file in vim\'s
diff mode (:help diff), with a window at the bottom showing the commit
message. Left and right arrows move through the history. Shift-left and
shift-right go all the way to the end. Return on a line goes back to the
last commit that touched that line (using git blame).

Close the tab when you're bored with it (:tabclose or :windo bd) and carry
on vimming as usual.

You can open as many time-lapse tabs on different files in one vim
session as you want.

Inspired by the "time lapse view" in the Perforce gui.
